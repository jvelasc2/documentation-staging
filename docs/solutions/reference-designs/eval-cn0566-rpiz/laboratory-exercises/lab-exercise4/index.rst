Lab 4: Sidelobes and Beam Tapering
==================================

Training Objective
------------------

In this lab, we’ll observe the side lobe amplitudes as we reduce the gain of the
antenna elements at the edge of the array.

Recall the impact to the sidelobe gain when we “window” or “taper” an array:

Instructions
------------

1. In the Phaser GUI, select ``Lab 3: Tapering``.
  
  .. figure:: sidelobestapering_2.png

2. Press ``Copy Plot to Memory``, then try one of the tapering profile buttons.

3. What is the impact to sidelobe level, beamwidth, and peak gain?

4. Select ``Symmetric Taper`` and invent your own profile! Can you make a “better”
   taper?
