Lab 6: Beam Squint
==================

Training Objective
------------------

In this lab, we will observe the change in steering angle as a function of
signal frequency.

Recall that beam deviation (beam squint) vs frequency can be calculated as:

.. figure:: beamsquint_1.png

For example:

- Let’s set our carrier frequency to be 10.5 GHz, and f0 = 10 GHz (500 MHz of BW)
- We want to steer the beam to +/- 45° from mechanical boresight
- Δθ = arcsin(10.5/10 * sin(45°)) - 45° = 3°
- **The beam will shift 3° at 10.5 GHz vs. 10 GHz**

Instructions
------------

1. In the Phaser GUI, select ``Lab 5: Beam Squint``.

2. Set the RF source (HB100) to an angle of about 50 degrees.

3. Click ``Copy Plot to Memory``.

4. **Record the peak angle (you can also turn on “Show Peak Angle” under “Plot
   Options” tab)**.

5. Change the ``Signal BW`` slider bar to 500 MHz.

6. Record the new peak angle. Does the difference between the two peaks match
   our ~3° calculation?

7. Try other *signal bandwidths* and observe the effect.

8. Try other *steering angles* and observe the effect.

.. note:: 
  Since our HB100 frequency source is fixed, we instead change the frequency
  at which the steering angle is calculated. i.e. the “Beam Calculated at”
  frequency. Both methods are equivalent. Its just easier to change the calculated
  frequency in our lab. It also avoids other changes in the antenna pattern that
  would come from a new frequency. And that lets us do a more straightforward
  comparison.
