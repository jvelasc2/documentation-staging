.. _iio-oscilloscope adrv9009 plugin:

Standard Plugin
===============

The ADRV9009 plugin works with the
:ref:`iio-oscilloscope`.
You always use the latest version if possible. Changing any field will immediately
write changes which have been made to the ADRV9009 settings to the hardware, and
then read it back to make sure the setting is valid. If you want to set
something that the GUI changes to a different number, that either means that GUI
is rounding (sorry), or the hardware (either the ADRV9009 or the FPGA fabric)
does not support that mode/precision.

If you want to go play with ``/sys/bus/iio/devices/....`` and manipulate the
devices behind the back of the GUI, it's still possible to see the settings by
clicking the "refresh" button at the bottom of the GUI.


.. tip::

   This plugin supports multiple device instantiations.
   Typically used in a multichip design, where all devices and links are being
   synchronized.
   In order to support this mode, all IIO devices need unique names.
   Such as:

   ::

      adrv9009-phy-d
      adrv9009-phy-c
      adrv9009-phy-b
      adrv9009-phy-a [JESD204 FSM Top Device]

   or:

   ::

      adrv9009-phy-3
      adrv9009-phy-2
      adrv9009-phy-1
      adrv9009-phy-0 [JESD204 FSM Top Device]

   When used with the JESD204 finite state machine framework.
   The Top Device needs to be suffixed with a letter or numeral smaller than the
   slave devices. (a < b < c … or 0 < 1 < 2 …)

If you think the device has a setting that isn't managed by this tab, check out
the :doc:`ADRV9009 Advanced Plugin <advanced-plugin>` for the IIO Oscilloscope.

The ADRV9009 view is divided in four sections:

* Device Global Settings
* Receive Chain
* Transmit Chain
* Observation Chain
* FPGA Settings

FPGA Settings
-------------

Transmit/DDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: adrv9009_main_plugin_3.png

The plugin provides several options on how the transmitted data is generated.

It is possible to either use the built-in two tone **Direct Digital Synthesizer
(DDS)** to transmit a bi-tonal signal on channels I and Q of the DAC. Or it is
possible to use the **Direct Memory Access (DMA) facility** to transmit custom
data that you have stored in a file.

This can be achieved by selecting one of the following options listed by the
**DDS Mode**:

One CW Tone
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: one_cw_tone.png
   :align: right

In **One CW Tone** mode one continuous wave (CW) tone will be outputted. The
plugin displays the controls to set the Frequency, Amplitude and Phase for just
one tone and makes sure that the amplitude of the other tone is set to 0. The
resulting signal will be outputted on the Channel I of the DAC and the exact
same signal but with a difference in phase of 90 degrees will be outputted on
the Channel Q of the DAC.

Two CW Tone
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: two_cw_tones.png
   :align: right

In **Two CW Tone** mode two continuous wave (CW) tones will be outputted. The
plugin displays the controls to set the frequencies F1 and F2, amplitudes A1 and
A2, phases P1 and P2 for the two tones. The resulting signal will be outputted
on the Channel I of the DAC and the exact same signal but with a difference in
phase of 90 degrees will be outputted on the Channel Q of the DAC.

Independent I/Q Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: iq_independent.png
   :align: right

In **Independent I/Q Control** the plugin displays the controls to set the
frequencies, amplitudes and phases for the two tones that will be outputted on
channel I and additionally it allows for the two tones that will be outputted on
channel Q of the DAC to be configured independently.

.. note::

   The bi-tonal signal (T) is defined as the sum of two tones:

   :math:`T(t) = A1 * sin(2 * p * F1 * t + P1) + A2 * sin(2 * p * F2 * t + P2)`,

   where A-amplitude, F-frequency, P-phase of a tone.

DAC Buffer Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: dac_output_buffer_panel.png
   :align: right

The file selector under the **File Selection** section is used to
locate and choose the desired data file. Under the **DAC Channels** section the
enabled channels will be used to transmit the data stored in the file. To
finalize the process, a click on the **Load** button is required.

Restrictions:

* There are two types of files than can be loaded: **.txt** or **.mat**. The
  IIO-Oscilloscope comes with several :git-iio-oscilloscope:`data files<waveforms>`
  that can be used. If you want to create your own data files please take a look
  at the :ref:`adrv9009 basic-iq-datafiles`
  documentation first.
* Due to hardware limitation only specific combinations of enabled channels
  are possible. You can enable a total of 1, 2, 4, etc. channels. If 1 channel
  is enabled then it can be any of them. If two channels are enabled then
  channels 0, 1 or channels 2, 3 can be enabled and so on.


Disable
~~~~~~~

In this mode both DDS and DMA are disabled causing the DAC channels to stop
transmitting any data.

.. note::

   Upon pressing **Reload Settings** button the values will be
   reloaded with the corresponding driver values. Useful in scenarios where the
   diver values get changed outside this plugin (e.g with the use of Debug
   plugin) and a refresh on plugin's values is needed.

.. attention::

   Some plugin values will be rounded to the nearest value supported by the
   hardware.
