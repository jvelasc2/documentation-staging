Libm2k
======

Libm2k is a C++ library for interfacing with the :ref:`m2k`, split into more
correlated components, interconnected by a context.

These m2k components represent the functionalities of ADALM2000:

-  AnalogIn - oscilloscope or voltmeter
-  AnalogOut - signal generator
-  Digital - logic analyzer or pattern generator
-  PowerSupply - constant voltage generator
-  DMM - digital multimeter

Libm2k can be used for encoding and decoding digital signals, communicating with
a wide variety of chips, using some well known protocols, such as SPI, IÂ²C or
UART. Created based on no-OS communication headers, libm2k communication segment
is build to interact with ADI's chips in a generic way. Regardless of protocol,
there are three common steps in any communication process: initialization,
writing/reading, freeing the resources. A more detailed view of communicating
with a peripheral is documented at :ref:`libm2k digital_communication`.

For an easier and faster control of m2k components, libm2k offers a command-line
frontend, called m2kcli. This command line tool also includes the functionality
of encoding and decoding digital signals. More information about m2kcli can be
found on at :ref:`libm2k m2kcli`.

How to install it?
------------------

Download
~~~~~~~~~

.. admonition:: Download

   Go to the :git-libm2k:`latest release page <releases/latest+>` and
   download the package that fits your system.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For Windows
+++++++++++


Download the ``libm2k-Windows-setup.exe`` and run through all the required
steps.

.. important::

   For libm2k versions starting with v0.6.0: The libm2k Windows
   installer does not include Python bindings. Check the Python bindings section
   for more details.

.. warning::

   For libm2k versions older than v0.6.0:
   Make sure you only select the libm2k Python bindings that correspond to your
   installed Python version.

For Linux
+++++++++

Download the ``libiio-ubuntu.deb`` for your system
(from the :git-libiio:`nightly builds <README.md>`) and install it by running:

.. shell::

   $sudo apt install -f ./libiio-package.deb

Download the libm2k-ubuntu.deb for your system and install it by running:

.. shell::

   $sudo apt install -f ./libm2k-package.deb

For OSX
+++++++

Download the ``libiio-darwin.pkg`` for your system
(from the :git-libiio:`nightly builds <README.md>`) and install it by running:

.. shell::

   $sudo installer -pkg /path/to/package.pkg -target /

Download the libm2k-darwin.pkg for your system and install it by running

.. shell::

   $sudo installer -pkg /path/to/package.pkg -target /

The ``m2kcli`` command line tool is also installed with the package. In order
to access it, the full path to it must be used
(*/Library/Frameworks/libm2k.framework/Tools/m2kcli*) or a symbolic link can
be created in the following way:

.. shell::

   $ln -s  /Library/Frameworks/libm2k.framework/Tools/m2kcli <path-to-accessible-location>/m2kcli


``<path-to-accessible-location>``: choose any location that is listed in the PATH
(example: */usr/local/bin* or */usr/bin*)

.. note::

   When installing the Python bindings, you must configure the library path
   correctly.
   After installing Python bindings (either by using the *.whl* provided on
   the release page or via a `pip`), run the following command:

.. shell::

   $install_name_tool -add_rpath /Library/Frameworks/ \
   $    /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/lib/python3.11/site-packages/_libm2k.cpython-311-darwin.so

.. attention::

   Adjust the `3.11` and `311` references from the example to match your
   specific Python version.

.. _libm2k build:

Building and installing bindings
--------------------------------

Python bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Option 1 - Download wheel packages**:
The easiest way to use the libm2k Python bindings is to install them using **pip**.
Starting with version v0.6.0, libm2k releases provide an archive containing
**wheels** for Windows, Linux, MacOS corresponding to Python versions 3.7, 3.8,
3.9 and 3.10.

.. shell::

   $python3 -m pip install ./libm2k-0.6.0-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl

**Option 2 - Use test.pypi.org**:
For every release starting with v0.6.0, all the Python wheels for libm2k will
be uploaded to test.pypi.org.
`Check the files and install instructions here <https://test.pypi.org/project/libm2k/#description>`__

**Option 3 - Conda packages**:
If you are using Conda, libm2k packages are made available and updated at every
major release.
:dokuwiki:`Check out more details here <university/tools/conda>`.

**Option 4 - Build the bindings**:
The Python bindings are enabled by default if SWIG and a correct Python version
are detected on your system.
They can be specifically enabled or disabled by using the following:

.. shell::

   ~/libm2k/build
   $cmake -DENABLE_PYTHON=ON/OFF ..

C# bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~

The C# bindings are **disabled** by default. They can be specifically
enabled (requires SWIG and a correct C# compiler) or disabled by using the
following:

.. shell::

   ~/libm2k/build
   $cmake -DENABLE_CSHARP=ON/OFF ..

MATLAB bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MATLAB bindings come pre-packaged through installers for Linux and Windows.
Further documentation is provided at :ref:`m2k matlab`.

LabVIEW bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LabVIEW bindings come pre-packaged through a .vip installer for Windows.
Further documentation is provided at :ref:`m2k labview`.

Other features
--------------

.. _m2kcli build:

Build m2k tools - m2kcli
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Building m2kcli is disabled by default. It can be enabled by running the
following

.. shell::

   ~/libm2k/build
   $cmake -DENABLE_TOOLS=ON ..

Building with logging support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The logging system is **disabled** by default. It can be specifically
enabled(requires glog library) or disabled by using the following:

.. shell::

   ~/libm2k/build
   $cmake -DENABLE_LOG=ON/OFF ..

There is one more layer of controlling the logging. After building libm2k with
logging support the user must enable the logging system from code, calling the
method enableLogging(true). By default the logging system is disabled.

Building the examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Building the examples is disabled by default. It can be enabled by running the
following

.. shell::

   ~/libm2k/build
   $cmake -DENABLE_EXAMPLES=ON ..
