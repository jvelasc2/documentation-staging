Software Infrastructure for designing with ADCs, DACs, and Sensors
===============================================================================

.. note::

   This is a work in progress.

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Analog Devices manufactures a dizzying array of products from simple, 2-terminal shunt voltage references to some of the most complicated communication and instrumentation devices in existence. ADCs, DACs, and sensors comprise a large subset of this space, and devices from the slow, jellybean LM75 temperature sensor to the Apollo MXfE share many of the same frameworks, programming interfaces, design and development tools.

This tutorial will use a part “somewhere in the middle” in terms of complexity, the AD4080 40 Msps Oversampling SAR ADC, as a launchpad for learning about the powerful tools available for supporting such a broad range of devices. This part’s versatility is ideal for illustrating several key software and hardware concepts:

- Microcontroller / FPGA decision factors
- Linux / no-OS / Zephyr support
- Language support
- Hardware and Software Enablement,  System Prototyping
- Signal chain architecture

This tutorial will cover each of these in summary, accompanied by hands-on exercises with hardware. We’ll test drive key software utilities, run example programs, take some basic performance measurements, and prototype a simple seismic application example for strategic and key (S&K) customer Fred in the Shed Instruments. Finally, we’ll show how concepts can be applied to other data converter products – PLLs, DDS, IMUs, and more.

The tutorial can be most easily run on a Raspberry Pi 4 or 400, but we’ll leave you with instructions on how to install everything on your ADI laptop, your co-worker’s Mac, and your other co-worker’s Linux box. You will walk away knowing how to bring up this portable, economical setup in customer lobbies, labs, and conference rooms. It also serves as a testing ground for elements that can be used in a future mixed-mode signal chain tutorial.

You may recognize some of the material; this tutorial builds upon two previous ones:

`Tools for Low-Speed Mixed Signal System Design <../tools_for_ls/index.html>`_

where we connected an AD5592r to a Raspberry Pi and built a transistor curve tracer, and

`Tools for Precision Wideband Mixed Signal System Design <../tools_for_prec_wb/index.html>`_

where we used an ADALM2000 as part of a colorimeter proof of concept, then demonstrated how easy it was to replace the ADALM2000 with an AD4630-24 ADC.

Software Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. important::

   The setup script installs several software packages, it is recommended to use a dedicated SD card for this exercise to avoid conflicts or overwriting anything important.

Write the ADI Kuiper Linux image onto the SD card. Directions and the image download are available at:

`Analog Devices Kuiper Linux <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/tools-software/linux-software/kuiper-linux>`_

In theory the latest Kuiper Linux release should always work, but this tutorial is tested with the 2023_r2 release. All previous releases are archived and available.

Boot up the Raspberry Pi and connect to the internet. Code and setup scripts for this workshop are available at:

`ftc24-ws Workshop Files <https://github.com/cristina-suteu/ftc24-ws/>`_

.. todo::

   Re-host code and setup scripts, perhaps in the analogdevicesinc/education_tools repo.

Open a termial and run the following commands:

::

   git clone https://github.com/cristina-suteu/ftc24-ws.git
   cd ftc24-ws 
   sudo ./workshopsetup.sh
   
This will download and install all of the prerequisite software needed for the rest of the exercise.

Exercise 1: Command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Multiple examples require running Linux commands. For those, open the terminal

IIO Info
--------
Communication with the various data converter sources and sinks is done through the Industrial I/O (IIO) framework. This framework is used for communicating with devices that are in some sense an ADC or DAC, and is the backbone of many of the tools we will use in this workshop. An important concept in IIO is the "Context". An IIO context usually refers to a computing device or a device driver that is capable of interfacing with IIO devices. The context is the starting point for all IIO operations, and is used to manage devices, channels, and buffers. The context can be local (on the same device), or remote (on a different device). The IIO context is created by the IIO backend, which is responsible for interfacing with the hardware.

There are three IIO contexts in our setup:
- The Raspberry Pi itself, whose backend is local. It has two IIO devices: an internal temperature sensor and a supply voltage monitor
- The ST Nucleo-H563ZI,whose backend is serial. It has one IIO device: the AD4080
- The ADALM2000, whose backend is either USB or netowrk. It has several IIO devices: the XADC housekeeping ADCs on the FPGA, the AD9963 ADC/DAC, and custom peripherals (triggering, waveform generation, DMAs) in the FPGA.

Let's use the ``iio_info`` utility to display information about...

...the ``local:`` context (raspberry pi cpu_thermal):

    ::
        
        iio_info
    
    Expected output: ::

...Next, the ``usb:`` context (ADALM2000):

    ::
        
        iio_info -u usb:

    Expected output: ::

        iio_info version: 0.26 (git tag:a0eca0d2)

        [... snip ...]

...the ``serial:/dev/ttyACM0,230400,8n1`` context (EVAL-AD4080):

    ::
        
        iio_info -u serial:/dev/ttyACM0,230400,8n1

The iio_info utility is handy for debugging setups, making sure contexts are available, and checking that devices are recognized. There are other command line utilities for reading and writing individual attributtes, reading and writing data to DMA buffers, but they're not very convenient for interactive use.

Exercise 2: Scopy (2.0!)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Scopy is a GUI application that provides the test instrument interfaces to the ADALM2000, as well as custom instruments for other hardware, such as the `AD-SWIOT1L-SL <https://www.analog.com/AD-SWIOT1L-SL>`__ Software-configurable Analog and Digital I/O with 10BASE-T1L. When  no board-specific control panel is available, a debug interface provides access to all IIO attributes for a given context, generic time and frequency domain plots, and DAC data managers. We will use Scopy to control and capture data from the AD4080 board.

Click the Scopy shortcut on the desktop as shown in :numref:`fig-open_scopy` (Note #1) and then choose “Execute” when prompted (#2). Once opened, it should detect the attached M2k. Click “Connect”
(#3).

.. warning::
    Do not open scopy from the start menu, because that will open an older
    version.

Simple sine wave from the M2K to the AD4080
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Start generating a sine wave using Scopy. In Thonny, load
**Desktop/ftc24-ws/hello_hw/hello_ad4080.py**
and click Run:

.. image:: hello_ad4080.png

Performance metrics with Genalyzer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stop the M2k waveform generator and close Scopy, because this demo will generate
a signal programaticaly. In Thonny, load
**Desktop/ftc24-ws/hello_genalyzer/m2k_source_ad4080_sink.py**
and Run:

.. image:: m2k_source_ad4080_sink.png

Exercise 4: Using libiio in C
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The libiio has language bindings for C, C#, Python, and MATLAB. This exercise will show how to use libiio in C.

In a terminal, navigate to **Desktop/ftc24-ws/hello_iio**

::
    
    cd ~/Desktop/ftc24-ws/hello_iio

Run ``ls -la`` to check the contents of this directory. Expected output:

::

    total 24
    drwxr-xr-x 2 analog analog 4096 Oct 29 15:51 .
    drwxr-xr-x 9 analog analog 4096 Oct 29 15:51 ..
    -rw-r--r-- 1 analog analog  132 Oct 29 16:03 CMakeLists.txt
    -rw-r--r-- 1 analog analog  733 Oct 29 16:03 hello_iio.c
    -rw-r--r-- 1 analog analog  204 Oct 29 16:03 how_2_build_cmake.txt
    -rw-r--r-- 1 analog analog   35 Oct 29 16:03 how_2_build_cmdline.txt

Take a look at the source code using the command ``geany hello_iio.c``. Check
the ``how_2_build_cmake.txt`` and ``how_2_build_cmdline.txt`` files for build
instructions.

Copy the command from ``how_2_build_cmdline.txt`` into the command line (Ctrl-Shift-C, Ctrl-Shift-V) and run it (there should be no console output): ::

    gcc hello_iio.c -o hello_iio -liio

Alternatively, you can use the CMake build system. For this project, run the following commands (also in ``how_2_build_cmake.txt``):

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

Both will have compiled an executable called hello_iio, which can be run in the command line: ::

    ./hello_iio

Expected output: ::

    102.979400 Fahrenheit Degrees
    39.433000 Celsius Degrees

Appendix A: IIOD and context forwarding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IIOD (IIO Daemon) is a program that creates libiio network contexts (``ip:...``) that are bound to any kind of context (could be ``local:``, ``usb:``, ``serial:``, etc.), acting like a middleman between the two, forwarding commands and data both ways. It is a great tool in managing connectivity in projects with multiple iio devices, which may potentially be connected to multiple hosts, allowing seamless communication between all of them.

Some **example use cases**:

- Exposing an iio context only visible to a Raspberry Pi's (such as the AD4080 serial context) to other computers on the network
- Connecting to multiple iio contexts through a single internet connection, using different ports for each device (four Phasers example in the slide deck)
- Backend compatibility: some libiio builds (such as the one bundled in MATLAB Toolboxes) don't support the serial backend. IIOD can forward the serial context to a port on the local (or loopback) network, allowing the MATLAB Toolbox to connect to that and access the device

IIOD runs on the computer that has access to the context you want to forward. In the case of this workshop, that is the Raspberry Pi to which the M2K and AD4080 are connected. To check which backends your build of libiio (which IIOD is part of) supports, run ``iio_info -V``: ::

    iio_info version: 0.26 (git tag:a0eca0d)
    Libiio version: 0.26 (git tag: a0eca0d) backends: local xml ip usb serial

To forward a context, first identify its URI:

- For the M2K, use ``usb:`` or ``ip:192.168.2.1``
- For the AD4080, use ``serial:/dev/ttyACM0,230400,8n1`` (or ACM1, depending on the order in which the Pi assigns serial device numbers)

Then choose a port on which iiod will listen. Kuiper linux already has an instance of iiod running on the default port (30431) forwarding the ``local:`` context. 

Examples:

To forward the M2K connection to port 50905, run: ::
    
    iiod -u ip:192.168.2.1 -p 50905

To forward the AD4080 connection to port 50907, run: ::
    
    iiod -u serial:/dev/ttyACM0,230400,8n1 -p 50907

.. note::
    Leave them running. Closing these processes (or their terminal window) will stop forwarding the context.

You can now use the context from any libiio application (e.g. the workshop
scripts, Scopy, iio-oscilloscope, iio_info, etc.).

For example, ``iio_info`` can now display the AD4080 context by connecting to the IIOD port (even from another computer on the network), instead of directly to the board: ::
    
    iio_info -u ip:analog.local:50907

.. note::
    In the above command, analog.local is the default hostname of a Kuiper Linux system. This can be replaced with another hostname or IP address as appropriate, if it was changed.
