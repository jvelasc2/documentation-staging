Overview of industrial control and automation systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Control systems such as computers, PLCs, and robots are utilized to manage
  industrial processes.
- They enhance efficiency, quality, and safety, while lowering operational
  costs.
- Common applications include automated assembly lines and process control in
  refineries.
- An industrial control system is a group of mechanical and/or electronic
  devices that manage other equipment or systems to control specific devices or
  various process parameters, such as temperature, humidity, or flow.

.. admonition:: Did you know?

    The first programmable logic controller (PLC) was invented in 1968 to
    automate automotive assembly lines, revolutionizing industrial automation.

**Examples of systems:**

#. SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition): Designed for monitoring
   and controlling field devices (either locally or remotely). SCADA systems
   collect, process, and visualize real-time data, and interact with sensors
   through SCADA software. Data is typically displayed on an HMI (Human-Machine
   Interface).

#. PLC (Programmable Logic Controllers): Modular devices of various sizes that
   include a microprocessor and a certain number of I/O channels, ranging from
   dozens to hundreds. PLCs are a fundamental component of industrial systems.

#. DCS (Distributed Control Systems): Similar in purpose to PLCs, DCSs control
   and monitor industrial equipment. The main difference is that DCSs use
   multiple controllers to distribute tasks across the entire system, while
   PLCs typically have a single centralized controller, making PLCs suitable
   for simpler control structures and well-defined tasks.

#. PID: Will be discussed in more detail later.

#. PAC (Programmable Automation Controller): Combines the features of a PLC and
   a PC to provide more flexible and high-performance control.

Industrial automation components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Sensors: Devices that detect changes in the environment and convert them
   into signals that can be read by a controller. Examples include temperature
   sensors, pressure sensors, and flow meters.

#. Actuators: Devices that convert control signals into physical actions, such
   as motors, valves, and pumps.

      .. image:: actuators.png
         :width: 400

#. Controllers: Devices that process input signals from sensors and send output
   signals to actuators to control the system. Examples include PLCs, DCSs, and
   PACs.

#. Human-Machine Interface (HMI): A user interface that allows operators to
   interact with the control system, monitor its status, and make adjustments
   as needed.

#. Communication protocols: Systems that enable data exchange between different
   components of the control system, such as Ethernet, Modbus, and Profibus.

#. Power supply: Provides the necessary electrical power to the control system components.

#. Software: Programs that run on controllers and HMIs to implement control
   algorithms, monitor system performance, and provide user interfaces.

Common control strategies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative): A widely used control strategy that
   adjusts the output based on the error between the desired setpoint and the
   measured process variable. PID controllers are effective for maintaining
   stable control in various industrial applications.

   .. image:: pid.png
      :width: 450
      :align: center

#. Feed-forward control: A proactive control strategy that anticipates changes
   in the process and adjusts the output accordingly, rather than reacting to
   errors after they occur.

#. Cascade control: A control strategy that uses multiple controllers in a
   hierarchical structure to manage complex processes. Each controller operates
   on a different level, allowing for more precise control and improved system
   performance.

   .. image:: on_off.png
      :width: 300
      :align: right

#. ON/OFF control: A simple control strategy that switches the output between
   two states (on and off) based on the process variable. This method is often
   used in applications where precise control is not required, such as in
   heating systems.

**Introduction to PWM control**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: pwm.png
   :width: 500
   :align: right

Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a technique used to control the power delivered
to electrical devices by varying the width of the pulses in a signal. It is
commonly used in applications such as motor control, LED dimming, and heating
systems.
PWM works by switching a signal on and off at a high frequency, with the ratio
of the on time to the total cycle time (duty cycle) determining the average
power delivered to the load. By adjusting the duty cycle, the effective voltage
and current can be controlled, allowing for precise control of devices.

**Applications of PWM control include:**

- Motor speed control: By varying the duty cycle, the speed of DC motors can be
  adjusted, allowing for smooth acceleration and deceleration.

- LED dimming: PWM can be used to control the brightness of LEDs by adjusting
  the duty cycle, providing energy-efficient lighting solutions.

- Heating systems: PWM can be used to control the power delivered to heating
  elements, allowing for precise temperature control in applications such as
  ovens and industrial furnaces.

Introduction to PID control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control is a widely used control
strategy in industrial automation systems. It combines three control actions to
maintain a desired setpoint by adjusting the output based on the error between
the setpoint and the measured process variable.
PID control works by continuously calculating the error and applying a
correction based on three terms:

   :width: 500

.. note::

    **Did you know?** The PID control algorithm was first developed in the
    early 20th century for automatic steering of shipsâ€”long before it became a
    staple in industrial automation.

#. Proportional (P): The proportional term produces an output that is
   proportional to the current error. It provides a quick response to changes
   in the process variable, but may lead to steady-state errors if used alone.

#. Integral (I): The integral term accumulates the error over time and produces
   an output that is proportional to the total accumulated error. It helps
   eliminate steady-state errors by adjusting the output based on the history
   of the error.

#. Derivative (D): The derivative term predicts future errors based on the rate
   of change of the error. It provides a damping effect, reducing overshoot and
   improving system stability.

PID control is widely used in various applications, including:

- Temperature control: Maintaining a specific temperature in processes such as
  chemical reactions, heating systems, and HVAC systems.

- Speed control: Regulating the speed of motors in applications such as
  conveyor systems, fans, and pumps.

- Position control: Controlling the position of mechanical systems, such as
  robotic arms and CNC machines

Hands-on activity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Participants will engage in hands-on activities to apply the theoretical
concepts learned. The activities will include:

#. Booting your PC Linux

#. Power the AD-SWIOT1L-SL board by plugging in the power supply.

#. Connect the USB to T1L media converter to your PC and the AD-SWIOT1L-SL
   board. After a short time, both link status LEDs(on the media converter and
   the board) should be on.

#. Testing the board connectivity

    - Open a terminal and run the command: ``ping 169.254.97.40`` This command
      will rule out the host (PC) network configuration issues.
