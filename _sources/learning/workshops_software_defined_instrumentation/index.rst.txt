**What is Software Defined Instrumentation?**

A single device encapsulating more instruments used for measurements, signal generation, signal acquisition, etc., powered by a PC open-source software that allows the user to customize the measurements, since the software is residing more on the host PC/mobile device instead of on the instrument.

Bonus: it has a pocket size!

**ADALM2000**

The ADALM2000 (M2K) Advanced Active Learning Module is an affordable USB-powered data acquisition module, that can be used to introduce fundamentals of electrical engineering in a self or instructor lead setting.

With 12-bit ADCs and DACs running at 100 MSPS, brings the power of high-performance lab equipment to the palm of your hand, enabling electrical engineering students and hobbyists to explore signals and systems into the tens of MHz without the cost and bulk associated with traditional lab gear.

When coupled with Analog Devices' Scopy™ graphical application software running on a computer, provides the user with high performance instrumentation.

*Hardware Setup*

   Schematic and Breadboard connections

*Steps*

- Connect the Vp power supply to the Vdd of the chip, set it to 5V

- Connect the GND pin to the GND of the M2K

- Beware not to connect the supply pins of the chip to the positive power of ADALM2000 and GND in a reversed order!

- Connect the digital pins to the corresponding chip pins as shown in the schematic.

- Configure the SPI interface in pattern generator to match the timing diagram of the AD5626 datasheet.

*Pattern generator signals*

- DIO0 - /CS

- DIO1 – SCLK

- DIO2 – SDIN

- DIO3 - /LDAC

- DIO4 - /CLR

*Setup*

- According to the time diagram, minimum SPI clock period is 30ns, set the SPI frequency to 1MHz

- Set CLK polarity and Phase to 1

- Set number of bytes per frame to 2

- Configure the /LDAC and /CLR signals:

- According to the AD5626 datasheet, the shift register contents are updated on the rising edge of /LDAC if /CLR is high.

- Set the pattern of DIO4 (/CLR) as “Number” and enter the value 1.

- /LDAC signal(DIO3) should have a rising edge before /CS falling edge and should be high as long as bits are transmitted serially.

- With respect to the stated conditions, the DIO3 signal needs to be set as pulse type 100kHz frequency, Low number of samples equal to 5, High 75, for the set frequency of the SPI 1MHz.

*Scopy instruments setup*

- Open Scope instrument and connect Scope channel 1 to output pin of the AD5626 (pin 8 of the IC)
- Enable the positive 5V Power supply
- Set some values in the Data control of the pattern generator SPI configurator
- Enable Channel 1 measurements to view the analog values
- Change the initially transmitted values
