Prerequisites
===============================================================================

What you need, depends on what you are trying to do. As a minimum, you need to
start out with:

#. The ADRV9026 based card.
#. A carrier platform. ADI does not offer these boards for sale or loan,
   getting one yourself is normal part of development or evaluation of the
   ADRV9026. Our recommended carriers (the ones we use all the time) are either:

   - The :xilinx:`AMD ZCU102 <zcu102>`. The fabric on this device is much
     larger, and if you are looking at targeting - this is the recommended
     option.
   - There are a few more boards, which do work, but are currently not yet
     supported. The experience of the fabric only solutions is very close to
     the ARM/FPGA SoC based solutions, but the GUI runs on a host PC (Windows
     or Linux).
   - :ref:`See the supported carriers <adrv9026 carriers>`.

#. Some way to interact with the platform,

   #. For the ARM/FPGA SoC platforms, this normally includes:

      - DisplayPort monitor
      - USB Keyboard
      - USB Mouse

   #. For the FPGA only solutions, this includes:

      - LAN cable (Ethernet)
      - Host PC (Windows or Linux)

#. Internet connection (without proxies makes things much easier) to update the
   scripts/binaries on the SD Card that came with the ADI FMC Card. (Firewalls
   are OK, proxies make things a pain).
#. RF Test equipment
