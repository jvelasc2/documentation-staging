ADALM-PLUTO Hardware
====================

Whether you want to understand the changes between revisions, or just understand
how to probe the PCB, this is where all the information should be.

.. _pluto hacking hardware connectors:

Connectors
----------

The PlutoSDR includes a button (``S1`` on the PCB), and two USB connectors.

   :width: 450px

The button can be defined by software, it is normally held on with a paper clip
or thumb tack during power on to put the device into a recovery mode. It can be
re-purposed to do other things.

The first USB connector (the middle one) is the USB OTG connector (can be the
USB HOST connector (cabled to a USB peripheral), or the USB peripheral connector
(cabled to a USB Host)).

The second USB connector (the one on the side) is for power only when running in
Host mode.

Removing the case
-----------------

   :width: 200px

The plastic case comes off quite easily, with the removal of two
black `Phillips <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_screw_drives#Phillips>`__
screws on the bottom of the case. This is a picture of the pre-production Rev B
boards. The production version may be different.
It will for sure be :dokuwiki:`CE and FCC certified </university/tools/pluto/common/regulatory_compliance>`
(already passed).

Removing the screws will allow you to take the top off the case, and expose the
PCB.

If you want to remove the PCB, and place it on the table, we recommend that you
attach
`Cylindrical Bumpers <https://www.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?KeywordSearch?Site=US&Keywords=3M156065-ND>`__
(also known as feet), on
the PCB to protect the components on the bottom of the PCB. These are not
included in the design, and must be purchased separately (as we don't expect too
many people wanting to do this).

Revisions
---------

Different revisions of the PlutoSDR does not include any major functionality
changes, and there is no difference for end users (there may be minor internal
feature changes). While it is natural to want the "latest" version, there is no
:adi:`specified <media/en/news-marketing-collateral/product-highlight/ADALM-PLUTO-Product-Highlight.pdf>`
functionality changes. All revisions are:

-  1x Rx SMA, Tuning from 325 MHz to 3.8 GHz, 200 kHz - 20 MHz of instantaneous
   bandwidth
-  1x Tx SMA, Tuning from 325 MHz to 3.8 GHz, 200 kHz - 20 MHz of instantaneous
   bandwidth
-  1x USB 2.0 OTG
-  1x USB power adapter
-  Linux / libIIO based software stack, compatible with MATLAB, Simulink, GNU
   Radio, Python, and others.

.. important::

   When you order from ADI's
   :adi:`authorized channels <en/about-adi/corporate-information/sales-distribution.html>`,
   you may get any revision listed below; there is no way to order one specific
   revision (it's a single part number), so do not ask - it's not possible.
   *Normally* inventory is managed via a FIFO (First In; First Out) mechanism, so
   the oldest inventory is shipped when an order is placed. However - warehouses
   have been known to misplace a box, and ship older inventory later.

If you really want to purchase a specific version - I'm sorry. There is no way.
That's just what you read in the paragraph above. Emailing anyone to ask for a
specific version will just get the same answer, and will consume everyone's
time. Please don't do it.

Which revision do I have?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are three ways to tell which revision you have (and they should all
match):

Look at the sticker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's printed on the back of the Pluto SDR (on the sticker) the below in Rev B:

.. image:: pluto_sticker.png
   :width: 200px

info.html page
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the ``file:///D:/info.html#version`` page, it will tell you (assuming that
your Pluto SDR drive is "D"):

   :width: 600px

Take it apart and look
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PCBs are slightly different (these pictures are the top sides).

If you look close, the revision of the PCB is etched in metal on the side
(Zoomed in for clarity).

Revision D
----------

Revision C was never released, and was identical to rev C (minus 2 blue
wires [1]_), so we are only releasing rev D info. Since firmware is the same
between rev D and C, the firmware identifies and recognizes rev D hardware as
rev ``C``.

Revision D started showing up in the wild early 2021.

New Rev D features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are new internal rev D features:

-  addition of internal `U.FL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirose_U.FL>`__
   connectors for:

   -  second receive channel
   -  second transmit channel
   -  Clock input
   -  Clock output (only a copy of Clock input, not functional for the internal
      clock)

-  USB UART
-  breakout pins for I2C and SPI
-  3.3V GPO levels

u.FL to SMA cables can be picked up for a few dollars at a variety of locations
including
`Digkey <https://www.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?KeywordSearch?Site=US&Keywords=U.FL%20to%20SMA>`__,
`Mouser <https://www.mouser.com/c/?q=U.FL%20to%20SMA>`__,
`AdaFruit <https://www.adafruit.com/product/851>`__ or
`Sparkfun <https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9145>`__.

The standard features - Rx1, Rx2, USB OTG work as previously. See how to add
these to your units, check out how to
:dokuwiki:`set config settings </university/tools/pluto/users/customizing#updating_to_the_ad9364>`.

    Enable Dual Receive and Dual Transmit for the new revision of Pluto

With a few more holes in the case, and a few dollars of cables, this should give
you something like (this connects the additional Rx and Tx, and CLK input):

     as well.

The 2nd Rx/Tx channel internal to the rev D is not test during production test.
If it works - bonus! If it doesn't work; Pluto is only advertised as a 1 Rx, 1
Tx radio, and that is guaranteed/production tested on each unit - and that is
what you received.

Why Do a rev E?
---------------

Don't know yet - we will keep track of the list here.

Revision B
----------

   .. important::

      Although the below files indicates the
      Xilinx ``XC7Z010-1CLG225C`` is used in the PlutoSDR, it is actually the Xilinx
      ``XC7Z010-1CLG225C4334`` (a single core version before the 7007 was released).
      We keep using the "special" version. If you are starting a new design - use the
      ``XC7Z007S-1CLG225C``.

     as well.

Why do a Rev C?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  our "low-risk" OTG changes, caused problems, since we put the VBUS monitoring
   (R88) on the wrong side of the fuse, and the inclusion of the DC choke. While
   the DC choke reduces noise, and there is no DC difference between PGDN, and
   GND, on certain hosts, with certain operating systems, there can be a 250mV
   AC difference between PGND and GND. Since the analog comparators inside the
   Microchip USB3320 will be referenced to GND (quiet), it appears to toggle
   between host mode and device mode. A temp workaround was to change this
   resistor (R88) from the recommended USB spec of 1k to 24.9k. R88 can be found
   on the back side, underneath the USB connector.

   .. image:: pluto_r88.png
      :width: 500px

-  We also had issue on ESD testing, and will be adding an ESD protection to the
   RF connector.
-  As a cost optimization (and feature enhancement), we may redo some of the
   power section (replacing the NCP339AFCT2G, ADM1177, with the
   `LTC4413 <http://cds.linear.com/docs/en/datasheet/441312ff.pdf>`__) - this is
   still TBD based on lab work to be done. One of the usability issues - is that
   the 2 NCP339AFCT2G devices are designed to be break before make - which
   causes the power supply to reset if you plug the ADALM-PLUTO into a PC (which
   causes it to boot), and then eventually a power supply (which causes the
   supply to disappear for a small time, and then re-appear). We don't think
   this is a huge issue, but it would be enhance the usability. It would mean
   however, that we loose the ability to read USB voltage/current (which we
   currently do in the :adi:`ADM1177`.
-  :ez:`Request <thread/93054>` to pin out the 2nd channel with
   pads/footprints.

Why do a Rev B?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  RF performance was bad. (EVM was poor, ~-32dBm; goal was -45dBm). This was
   due to the Rakon oscillator having no PPSR [2]_, and us powering the
   oscillator directly from a 1.8V digital rail (which was noisy). A LDO was
   `dead bugged <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-point_construction#.22Dead_bug.22_construction>`__
   onto rev A, and it fixed the performance problem. We tried a few L/C &
   ferrites, but it was not as good as the LDO, so we added an ultralow noise
   LDO, the :adi:`ADM7160ACPZN1.8 <ADM7160>` to the design.
-  RF performance was bad on certain PCs, even with with the added LDO (above).
   This was tracked down to to noise on the power supply. We added a power choke
   (DLW5BSM801TQ2L), and this went away, and we got much better results
   independent of platform.
-  Power supply noise was a little higher than we would have liked, and was
   effecting RF performance, so sync'ed the multiple switchers together to
   reduce input ripple. This also allowed us to reduce input capacitance on the
   entire unit.
-  were barely passing FCC, (due to noise @ 480MHz, which was also causing some
   RF issues at 480 MHz), so added DLW21HN900SQ2L (90Ω choke) on the USB lines.
-  swapped QSPI flash and DDR3L devices, to something not on the obsolete list.
-  based on early end user feedback, added some test points to unused pins to
   make extending the device a little easier.
-  based on early end user feedback, added On-The-Go support for USB. This was
   some minor power circuit, and monitoring VBUS, so was looked at as "low risk"

Datasheets
----------

Here are some pointers to datasheets that are sometimes hard to find.

-  `Rakon <https://www.rakon.com/>`__ :dokuwiki:`1.8V RXO3225M 40MHz <_media/university/tools/pluto/hacking/rakon_rxo3225m_40mhz_513371_1.8v.pdf>`

Before PlutoSDR
---------------

Like all things, PlutoSDR is a integration/copy/paste of previous known working
platforms. There were a few different AD936x /Zynq platforms that were worked on
that we borrowed things from:

-  :dokuwiki:`FMCOMMS3 FMC Card </resources/eval/user-guides/ad-fmcomms3-ebz/hardware>`,
   which includes the baluns/RF and connection back to the Zynq
-  :dokuwiki:`FMCOMMS5 FMC Card </resources/eval/user-guides/ad-fmcomms5-ebz/hardware>`,
   which is where we borrowed the (buggy) oscillator design, since the AD9363
   can not be used with a crystal.
-  PicoZed SDR (which is were most of the Zynq and USB comes from).
