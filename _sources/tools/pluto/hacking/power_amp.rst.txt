Controlling External Devices
============================

While this was requested to better understand how to control external power
amplifiers for various software to implement
`push to talk <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push-to-talk>`__ (PTT), and ensure the PA
was off during the Rx portion, this is good practice for any application which
is just doing Rx or just doing Tx for best performance. Even you you are not
concerned about controlling external devices, this may be a good read for some
(just skip the GPO discussions).

There are two ways to implement General Purpose Output (GPO), Automatically (the
easy way), or Software Controlled (which is handled later).

Background
----------

The :adi:`AD9363` transceiver inside the ADALM-PLUTO includes an
Enable State Machine (ENSM) that allows real time control over the current state
of the device. The device can be placed in several different states during
normal operation, including:

-  Wait — power save, synthesizers disabled
-  Sleep — wait with all clocks and the BB PLL disabled
-  Time Division Duplex (TDD) Tx — Tx signal chain enabled (Rx signal chain
   powered down)
-  Time Division Duplex (TDD) Rx — Rx signal chain enabled (Tx signal chain
   powered down)
-  Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) — Tx and Rx signal chains enabled, where both
   Tx and Rx can be used simultaneously at different frequencies.
-  Alert — synthesizers enabled

In this document, we will mainly focus on the Frequency Division Duplex (FDD)
mode and the Time Division Duplex (TDD) Tx & Rx modes.

While the default settings are FDD mode (where Tx and Rx signal chains are
always enabled), there are many use cases where TDD (Time Division Duplex) mode
is beneficial. The ENSM has two control modes (1) SPI control and (2) pin
control. If the TDD is a slotted system, where μsecond timing requirements must
be met, pin control from a FPGA based state machine is normally used. When the
TDD system is random, or push to talk, SPI control is possible. In SPI control
mode, the ENSM is controlled asynchronously by writing to SPI registers to
advance the current state to the next state. SPI control is considered
asynchronous to the device or sample clock because the SPI clock can be derived
from a different clock reference and can still function properly. The SPI
control ENSM mode is recommended when real-time control of the synthesizers is
not necessary.

The AD9363 also include 4 ``GPO_[0:3]`` General-Purpose Output pins. These are
general-purpose logic output pins. These pins are designed to control other
peripheral devices such as regulators/switches via the SPI bus, or they function
as slaves for the internal AD9363 state machine. They can be configured to
assert when the the Rx or Tx is active.

More information about the :adi:`AD9363` can be found on the product
page.

ADALM-PLUTO implementation
--------------------------

VDD_GPO
~~~~~~~

The power connected to the ``VDD_GPO`` pin is 1.3 V The output voltage on the
``GPO_[0:3]`` pins is expected to be ``VDD_GPO × 0.8`` (1.04 V) and ``VDD_GPO``
(1.30 V). With an output current of 10 mA (typical). The off resistance of the
GPO pins is 15 Ω. The on resistance of the GPO pins is 32 Ω. If you connect
regulators or switches, it may need to be level shifted/have the drive strength
increased to achieve the proper voltage control thresholds.

With the 1.3 V ``VDD_GPO`` net, it is known/understood that the AUX_ADC and
AUX_DAC will not be functional.

Pinout
~~~~~~

The :ref:`schematic <pluto hacking hardware>` connects the ``GPO_[0:3]`` pins to ``GPO[0:3]``
nets and test points.

.. image:: pluto_gpo_pins.png
   :width: 400px

Just connect these ``GPO[0:3]`` pins to whatever you need to control.

Software
~~~~~~~~

There is a setup portion (if you are unsure of what these attributes do, check
out the
:dokuwiki:`documentation </resources/tools-software/linux-drivers/iio-transceiver/ad9361-customization>` [1]_ :

#. set up the part in TDD mode (``0`` is TDD mode, ``1`` is FDD mode):

   .. shell::

      $iio_attr -a -D ad9361-phy adi,frequency-division-duplex-mode-enable 0

#. set up ``GPO_0`` to assert when in Tx mode

   .. shell::

      $iio_attr -a -D ad9361-phy adi,gpo0-slave-tx-enable 1

#. write the new configuration to the part

   .. shell::

      $iio_attr -a -D ad9361-phy  initialize 1

Verify the setup is in TDD mode, by checking the ``ensm_mode_available``
attribute, and making sure it includes ``rx`` and ``tx`` and not ``fdd``.

.. shell::

   $iio_attr -a -d ad9361-phy ensm_mode_available
    dev 'ad9361-phy', attr 'ensm_mode_available', value :'sleep wait alert rx tx pinctrl'

Then there is a run time configuration that is needed.

#. To set the part into Receive only mode:

   .. shell::

      $iio_attr -a -d ad9361-phy ensm_mode rx

#. To set the part into Tx only mode:

   .. shell::

      $iio_attr -a -d ad9361-phy ensm_mode tx

When you change from Rx mode to Tx mode, any of the four pins will
assert/de-assert.

.. important::

   It should be noted that trying to capture a buffer (ie Rx) while
   in Tx mode will pause/hang until timed out. And sending a buffer (Tx) while in
   Rx mode will also pause/hang. Cancelling things will return.

There is a short bash script that shows how to use pin control from userspace:
:git-linux_image_ADI-scripts:`test_ensm_pinctrl.sh`

Test Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A small script on the Pluto SDR (or host) will demonstrate:

.. code:: bash

   #!/bin/sh

   # Setup : Put into TDD mode, and setup GPO0 and GPO1
   iio_attr -q -a -D ad9361-phy adi,frequency-division-duplex-mode-enable 0
   iio_attr -q -a -D ad9361-phy adi,gpo0-slave-rx-enable 1
   iio_attr -q -a -D ad9361-phy adi,gpo1-slave-tx-enable 1
   iio_attr -q -a -D ad9361-phy  initialize 1

   while [ 1 ] ; do
     iio_attr -q -a -d ad9361-phy ensm_mode rx
     # capture buffer
     iio_attr -q -a -d ad9361-phy ensm_mode tx
     # transmit buffer
   done

by placing a scope on the GPO0 and GPO1 pins, you can see the levels switch, as
the Pluto transitions between Receive and Transmit.

.. tip::

   While this shows the Rx/Tx switching in 30-35ms or so, this is
   based on software control over SPI, running in an interpreted bash shell. Doing
   things in a C application, would make things faster, and doing things via pin
   control (via a state machine in the FPGA) can make things sub ~30 μs between Rx
   and Tx swaps to handle slotted specifications like LTE. IF you need things to go
   faster - just ask.

OK, someone asked for the C code - it's pretty trivial, just longer. You will
need to change the uri, and put in proper error checking.

.. code:: c

   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <iio.h>
   #include <unistd.h>
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <signal.h>


   volatile sig_atomic_t stop = 0;

   void inthand(int signum) {
           stop = 1;
   }

   int main(int argc, char argv)
   {
           struct iio_context ctx;
           struct iio_device dev;
           struct iio_channel ch;
           const char val_str;
           ssize_t ret = 0;
           char buf[256];

           signal(SIGINT, inthand);

           / Create IIO Context /
           ctx = iio_create_context_from_uri("usb:1.3.5");

           / Find IIO device in current context /
           dev = iio_context_find_device(ctx, "ad9361-phy");

           / Write into the IIO debug attributes /
           iio_device_debug_attr_write_bool(dev, "adi,frequency-division-duplex-mode-enable", 0);
           iio_device_debug_attr_write_bool(dev, "adi,gpo0-slave-rx-enable", 1);
           iio_device_debug_attr_write_bool(dev, "adi,gpo1-slave-tx-enable", 1);
           iio_device_debug_attr_write_bool(dev, "initialize", 1);

           while (!stop) {
                   ret++;
                   iio_device_attr_write(dev, "ensm_mode", "rx");
                   iio_device_attr_write(dev, "ensm_mode", "tx");
           }
           iio_context_destroy(ctx);
           printf("iteration = %li\n", ret);
           return EXIT_SUCCESS;
   }

Over USB, you get:

::

    time ./foo
   ^Citteration = 2693

   real    0m5.283s

or about 0.980876346 ms per Rx/Tx slot.

Again, these are representative numbers for software control, faster is possible
with pin control.

Testing in IIO Oscilloscope
---------------------------

The :dokuwiki:`Advanced Tab </resources/tools-software/linux-software/fmcomms2_advanced_plugin#axillary_io_adc_dac_control_io_temp_sensor>`
indicates how to control these in the IIO oscilloscope.

   If you want to delay the assertion of these pins by ``n`` μs, that can be
   done with the ``gpo0-rx-delay-us`` or ``gpo0-tx-delay-us`` attributes (which
   we don't cover here
