For Hackers
===========

`Hacking <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture>`__ the ADALM-PLUTO is
possible (and encouraged). In this case - what we mean by *hacking* is the act
of programming or extending the functionality or use cases of the PlutoSDR, in a
spirit of playfulness and exploration. In order to do that, you should be
familiar with the device, from a :ref:`user <pluto users>` and
:ref:`developer <pluto devs>` standpoint.

Many aspects of the PlutoSDR are based from the
:dokuwiki:`AD-FMCOMMS3-EBZ </resources/eval/user-guides/ad-fmcomms3-ebz>`, and you
should be familiar with that, as it will help understand how to extend the
PlutoSDR.
