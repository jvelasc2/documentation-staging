Support
=======

If you have any questions regarding the ADALM-PLUTO (PlutoSDR) or are
experiencing any problems following the user guides, or experiments feel free to
ask us a question. Questions can be asked on our :ez:`EngineerZone support community </>`,
specifically the :ez:`Virtual Classroom <community/university-program>`.
Calling on the phone, emailing someone directly, will only cause things to get
answered in much slower manner - if at all.

Before asking questions please also take the time to check if somebody else
already asked the same question and already got an answer. EngineerZone is a big
place, with lots of places to post questions, and it's possible to ask a
question in the wrong place, where no one familiar with these
boards/parts/software monitors things, and it will go unanswered forever. Don't
get mad if this happens. The problem is between the chair and the keyboard
(you). If you are posting in the right place, and the question is unanswered for
a few working days, please bump the thread (we are human, and sometimes miss
things).

End user/Student questions should always be posted in the
:ez:`Virtual Classroom <community/university-program>`. If you are not sure where to
post your question, post it there, and we can move it around for you.

As you transition from user to hacker to developer to SDR engineer, and dig
deeper into the stack (and we encourage that), you may have further questions
about why we did something, to save a little time, you may want to triage your
own question, and just post it in the right place, to save us the time of moving
things. (you will get answers faster).

Linux Driver or libiio or Application Questions
-----------------------------------------------

For questions regarding the the ADI Linux distribution used in PlutoSDR (which
is based `buildroom <https://buildroot.org/>`__ with
:ref:`libiio` library, the Linux
drivers (including the :dokuwiki:`AD936x driver </resources/tools-software/linux-drivers/iio-transceiver/ad9361>`, or
the device trees for PlutoSDR, please use the
:ez:`Linux Software Drivers <community/linux-device-drivers/linux-software-drivers>`
sub-community.

If you have generic userspace questions (*how do I use a standard linux tool*),
we should suggest to use your favorite `search tool <http://www.google.com/>`__
to find that tool/utility/application support method (some use email, some use
web). If you think you have found a bug specific to ARM, please report this to
the package maintainers upstream.

HDL / Vivado WebPack Questions
------------------------------

For questions regarding the PlutoSDR HDL design please ask them in the
:ez:`FPGA Reference Designs <community/fpga>` sub-community. If you have questions
about the Vivado HL WebPACK Edition, including any questions about compiling the
design with please go ask `Xilinx <http://forums.xilinx.com/>`__.

Hardware Questions
------------------

For questions regarding the PlutoSDR hardware (schematic or layout) please ask
them in the :ez:`Virtual Classroom <community/university-program>`.
sub-community. That is where the folks who designed and laid out the PCB hang
out.

General AD9361 Questions
------------------------

Questions about the AD9361 or AD9364, please use the
:ez:`AD9361 <community/wide-band-rf-transceivers/design-support>`
sub-community.

Detailed documentation on the AD9361 device can be found at:
:adi:`AD9361 Design support package <en/rfif-components/rfif-transceivers/products/AD9361-Integrated-RF-Agile-Transceiver-Design-Res/fca.html>`

AD9361/4 FIR Filter Wizard
--------------------------

Questions about the :dokuwiki:`AD936x FIR Filter Wizard </resources/eval/user-guides/ad-fmcomms2-ebz/software/filters>` can be
asked on :ez:`Analog Devices Filter Wizard Support support <sw-interface-tools>`.

MATLAB/Simulink/RF Blockset Questions
-------------------------------------

Questions about the AD936x RF Blockset model from MathWorks, or the PlutoSDR
Hardware support package can be asked either:

- :mw:`MathWorks Technical Support <support/contact_us.html>`

Questions about the Analog Devices provided Filter Wizard, or streaming system
object, or Board Support Package can be asked:

- :ez:`Analog Devices MATLAB/Simulink support <sw-interface-tools>`

GNU Radio and Python
--------------------

Questions about using the PlutoSDR with GNU Radio or python, can be asked on
Analog Devices' :ez:`Software Tools <sw-interface-tools>` sub-community.
Generic questions about GNU Radio should be asked on their `mailing list <https://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/MailingLists>`__.

Bugs / Feature Requests
-----------------------

If you think you have a bug to report, the best place to to this is the
:ez:`Virtual Classroom <community/university-program>`.
This way we can discuss if the
bug is a bug, or a feature request, or just missing documentation.

If you think you have a real bug, where you have developed a real fix (first -
thanks), feel free to:

#. post something on engineerzone
#. post something on the github issue tracker
#. `Fork <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/>`__ the github
   repository, and fix it, and then send a pull request

Either is OK with us.
