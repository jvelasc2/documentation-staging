==============

In a few of the designs we have done, like the
:ref:`pluto` and :ref:`m2k` there hasn't been enough room on the
PCB for serial and JTAG, so we put it on a small breakout board, which
communicates to the main platform with a small 10-pin ribbon cable, which is
known as the :adi:`ADALM-UARTJTAG`.

This includes the Silicon Labs
`CP2103-GM <https://www.silabs.com/Support%20Documents/TechnicalDocs/CP2103.pdf>`__
USB to UART bridge, which you can plug a USB cable into.

This also includes connection to Xilinx JTAG cable as well. You will need a
:xilinx:`Xilinx JTAG Cable <support/documentation/data_sheets/ds593.pdf>` or
`equivalent <https://store.digilentinc.com/jtag-hs3-programming-cable>`__ to use
it.

Hardware
--------

Analog Devices provides a small adapter board
:adi:`ADALM-UARTJTAG` to be used for JTAG and UART, in order
to make that easier for programming and debugging. You are encouraged to use
this on your designs for the same reason we do - the standard JTAG connector is
huge, and there are times where good old fashion console UART is valuable for
doing debug. The 1.8V supply on the connector above is the I/O voltage, and can
be used anywhere between 1.8V and 3.3V.

In the box, you should have received the UARTJTAG board, ribbon cable, and
jumper.

The PCB includes a jumper, which forces the Zynq to HALT on JTAG. This is great
for halting, and not allowing anything to run, but does pull down a chip select
for SPI flash, and will not allow the SPI flash to be found by the on-chip
bootloader, or by U-Boot. (If you are loading a U-Boot over JTAG).

The pin connector is likely inserted into the ribbon cable:

but can be removed, and either soldered to the PCB, or left in the ribbon cable,
so you don't lose it.

If you do want more, they can be obtained from
`Samtec <https://www.samtec.com/products/ftsh-105-01-l-d>`__,

Anyone is free to use the same pinout on their platform - or copy the schematics
and make it themselves.
