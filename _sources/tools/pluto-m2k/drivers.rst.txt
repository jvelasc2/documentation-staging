Linux Drivers
=============

Make sure the following modules are installed in your kernel:

- cdc-acm,cdc_ether
- rndis_host
- rndis_wlan
- usbnet

On most modern distributions - these will be installed/compiled by default. It
should just be a simple matter to plug the USB cable into your Linux machine. We
have tested and verified on these distributions:

- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  [1]_
- SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 12  [2]_
- Debian 8.x
- Debian 9.1
- SUSE Leap 15
- SUSE Leap 15.1

It is likely that other distributions can use the ADALM-PLUTO or ADALM2000, but
we are in a limited position to provide technical support for those
distributions.

In order to access some USB functions without root privileges, it's
recommended to install the PlutoSDR or ADALM2000 udev rules. Simply download
:git-plutosdr-fw:`53-adi-plutosdr-usb.rules <master:scripts/53-adi-plutosdr-usb.rules>`
or
:git-m2k-fw:`53-adi-m2k-usb.rules <master:scripts/53-adi-m2k-usb.rules>`
and copy into into the */etc/udev/rules.d*/ folder.

You can also use
:dokuwiki:`this plutosdr-m2k-udev.deb package </university/tools/pluto/drivers/plutosdr-m2k-udev_1.0_amd64.deb>`
to install both the PlutoSDR and the ADALM2000
udev rules.
To install the debian package, use one of the following:
``sudo apt-get install ./plutosdr-m2k-udev.deb`` or
``sudo dpkg -i plutosdr-m2k-udev.deb``.
Afterwards reload rules or restart udev, using either
``udevadm control --reload-rules`` or ``sudo service udev restart``

Example dmesg
-------------

When plugging Pluto in (m2k should be similar), you (if you are looking), you
will see kernel messages of:

interface with the devices in the normal linux methods.

If you happen to see something like:

::

The solution is to use an external hub and after that all works.

Ethernet
--------

.. caution::

   Like most of the network settings on Pluto or the M2k - things are
   meant to be easy to use. This also means things are inherently insecure.

.. shell::

The *weird* ``enx00e022d6d804`` comes from systemd on a debian based
distribution (which my host is). The enu prefix (or sometimes wlu) would
describe the USB port, and the rest ``00e022d6d804`` is the host USB MAC
address. This is what it uses, rather than a USB path (like
``usb-0000:00:14.0-2``, which is how the kernel refers to things) since USB path
aren't persistent nor predictable (it changes depending on the port you plug
things into).

.. _pluto-m2k drivers ssh-config:

ssh config
~~~~~~~~~~

Adding a quick/short :git-plutosdr_scripts:`ssh config file <ssh_config>`,
which describes the USB device can be helpful. It's maintained in github, and
it's a simple matter of grabbing the raw text file. You shouldn't do the exact
below unless you have no ``~/.ssh/config`` file.
Otherwise, click :git-plutosdr_scripts:`on this link <master:ssh_config>`
and copy/paste it into the system wide ``/etc/ssh/ssh_config`` file, or the user
specific ``~/.ssh/config`` file.

Since the ssh key on the pluto changes every boot, we want to be able to never
store the key (so we store it to ``/dev/null``. This does make it easier to use
(don't need to continually edit the ``known_hosts`` file), but does make things
susceptible to man in the middle attacks.

.. _pluto-m2k drivers windows:

Windows Drivers
===============

There are different aspects of the software for the ADALM-PLUTO and ADALM2000:

-  device drivers, which allows your PC to properly set up communication between
   your PC and the actual device, and
-  application code, like MATLAB, Simulink, GNU Radio, iio-oscilloscope (aka
   osc), or scopy.

To install the drivers, it's a simple matter of downloading and executing the
driver installer.

.. important::

   Before running the installer, please ensure that the
   hardware supported by the drivers is not already connected. If the hardware is
   connected when the installer is run, the installation of the driver files may
   fail.

.. admonition:: Download

   This download should support all of: Windows 11, Windows
   10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7 Service Pack 1. If you run into issues,
   please :ez:`let us know <community/university-program>`.

   :git-plutosdr-drivers-win:`Windows USB drivers for PlutoSDR and M2k (Windows 32-bit / 64-bit) <releases+>`

At the end, you should see a picture like (either for Pluto or M2k):

   .. image:: device_manager_m2k_installed.png
      :width: 300px

DFU Mode
--------

If you don't see the above, and see something like this instead, this means the
device is in
:ref:`dfu_update <pluto-m2k firmware dfu_update>`
mode. It's likely in this mode since a bad firmware is in the device; or a
firmware update failed for some reason. To recover from this, ensure the latest
firmware is installed on the device.

.. image:: dfu.png
   :width: 300px

Drivers uninstall
-----------------

From the control panel navigate to Programs and Features. Double click or right
click and select Uninstall. Uninstalling the PlutoSDR-M2k-USB-Win-Drivers
package will automatically remove the Windows Driver Packages (USBser, WinUSB
and Net) shown below as well.

.. image:: drivers-uninst.png
   :width: 800px

USB Devices
-----------

Once the drivers are installed, and the device (Pluto or M2k) is plugged in, the
following subsystems should be ready to use:

- USB Composite Device (The device is a single USB gadget that has the ability
  to perform more than one function, and needs to be exposed to the operating
  system as multiple devices)
- USB Ethernet/RNDIS Gadget (Remote Network Driver Interface Specification
  (`RNDIS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNDIS>`__) is a Microsoft proprietary
  protocol used mostly on top of USB. It provides a virtual Ethernet link to
  most versions of the Windows, Linux and OS X operating systems. To the host,
  the usb device acts as an external Ethernet card)
- USB Mass Storage
  (`USB Mass Storage <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_mass_storage_device_class>`__ is a
  set of protocols defined by the USB Implementers Forum that makes a USB
  device accessible to any host computing device and enables file transfers
  between the host and the USB device. To a host, the USB device acts as an
  external hard drive.)
- Serial Console (115200-8N1), in this case COM15, but it will be different on
  your PC.
- IIO USBD
- Linux File-Stor Gadget USB Device (which allows the USB mass storage to work
  properly).

Serial
------

You need to have find your favorite Terminal program, here are a few of the ones
we use (but don't support - if you have questions, please check with the
internet/google).

- `Putty <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html>`__
- `Tera Term <https://en.osdn.jp/projects/ttssh2/releases/>`__
- Or other Terminal program

The terminal settings are 115200 baud, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit. This is
referred to as 115200-8N1. The default username is ``root``, and the default
root password is ``analog``.

Finding the serial port (which constantly changes, every time you plug a device
in), is just matter of checking device manager (see above).

Mass Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~

It should be a simple matter of opening the drive, in this case, double click on
"D", to get at the info.html page.

.. image:: pluto_drive.png

Ethernet
--------

.. caution::

   Like most of the network settings on Pluto or the M2k - things are
   meant to be easy to use. This also means things are inherently insecure.

For example - the root password of Pluto is ``analog``. We post it on the
Internet. Think about that for a moment. This could allow anyone with an IP
connection to take over the device and use it for malicious purposes.

**Never** set up a bridge between the Internet and a network connected Pluto
with the default images.

Unfortunately - nothing on your host understands the what the IP address of the
usb device is. You, the human behind the keyboard need to understand this before
any sort of networking will work. There are two main ways to do this:

Determine the IP address

The IP address is set by the device and can be found by looking inside the
ADALM-PLUTO's mass storage device, and the ``info.html`` page. Just click on the
``version`` button at the top of the page:

.. image:: version_button.png

and then check out the Pluto IP address, and the host IP address.

.. image:: pluto_ip_addr.png

In this case, the IP address of the PLUTO device is ``192.168.2.1`` (which is
the default for all devices). If you need to change this (if you have multiple
devices), please check the :dokuwiki:`customizing Pluto <university/tools/pluto/users/customizing>`
documentation.

Checking from serial port
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open your favorite serial application:

.. shell::

    Welcome to Pluto
    pluto login: root
    Password: analog
    Welcome to:
    %%
      ______ _       _        _________________

IIO devices
~~~~~~~~~~~

The IIO device shows up in device manager, and allows you to make native IIO
connections to the device.

Bringing up a Windows Console should show you something like this:

.. shell:: ps1

   /c/
   $iio_info -s
    Library version: 0.16 (git tag: 5cdeaaa)
    Compiled with backends: local xml ip usb serial
