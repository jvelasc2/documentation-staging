Hardware User Guide
====================

Introduction
-------------

The :adi:`AD-PAARRAY3552R-SL` is designed in a small form
factor to manage the power sequencing of an RF transmitter signal chain, and is
engineered to facilitate power sequencing for a two-stage Doherty amplifier
(LDMOS + GaN) along with a one-stage Doherty amplifier (GaN only). However,
users have the freedom to employ any GaN amplifiers of their choice.

The design incorporates the :adi:`AD3552R` dual-channel, 16-bit DAC
which allows an ultrafast sub-µs Voltage settling time of GaN gates from
pinch-off to the normal operating Voltage.

This also includes a high-side NMOS static switch driver,
:adi:`LTC7000`, which adeptly handles key fault events such as
overvoltage, overcurrent, and overtemperature.

The on-board :adi:`MAX32666` ultralow power Arm Cortex®-M4
microcontroller exposes all the necessary debug and programming features to
enable a complete software development experience with the system. The system’s
firmware is based on ADI’s open-source no-OS framework and a user-friendly
graphical user interface (GUI) for evaluation and further development.

The system can be powered from an external +38V to +55V supply, making it
suitable for applications requiring high current capabilities.

Power Supply Connectors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These connectors are used to supply +48V to the entire circuitry.
The :adi:`AD-PAARRAY3552R-SL` provides an option for the
user to use either a barrel jack connector or a two-wire terminal.

- **P1** - Barrel connector jack. Use this port if a 5.5 mm x 2.5 mm barrel jack
  adapter is preferred.

Board Modification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The AD-PAARRAY3552R-SL requires some hardware modifications, which will depend
on the amplifier you plan to use. Here are the parameters that need modification
before using the board:

- Fault Settings
- Inrush Current Limiter

Fault Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The hardware is capable of detecting fault events such as overvoltage,
overcurrent, and overtemperature. Below are the default settings for
these fault events. You will need to adjust these settings based on the
power amplifier you are using.

- Overvoltage: +55V
- Undervoltage: +38V
- Overcurrent: 3.5A
- Overtemperature: +75°C

**Overvoltage Settings**

The LTC7000s OVLO pin manages the overvoltage event. If the voltage on this pin
exceeds 1.21V, an overvoltage fault will be flagged. Below are the default
resistor values for a +55V and +60V overvoltage. Adjust the following resistor
values to set your desired overvoltage. Refer to :adi:`LTC7000` datasheet for
more information.

- +55V overvoltage
  - R3, R114 = 1Meg
  - R4, R115 = 22.6K

- +60V overvoltage
  - R24 = 1Meg
  - R25 = 21K

**Undervoltage Settings**

The LTC7000s RUN pin manages the undervoltage event. If the voltage on this pin
falls below 1.11V, an undervoltage fault will be flagged. Below are the default
resistor values for a +38V and +6V undervoltage. Adjust the following resistor
values to set your desired undervoltage. (Please note that the LTC7000 does not
support a fault flag on its FAULT pin when an undervoltage event occurs, so we
are unable to detect this kind of fault. However, the device will automatically
shut off in such a case). Refer to :adi:`LTC7000` datasheet for more
information.

- +38V undervoltage
  - R156, R177 = 1Meg
  - R172, R160 = 29.4K

- +6V undervoltage
  - R26 = 1Meg
  - R23 = 221K

**Overcurrent Settings**

The LTC7000's SNS and ISET pin are responsible for the
overvoltage event. Below are the default resistor values for a 3.5A
overcurrent. Adjust the following resistor values to set your desired
overcurrent. Refer to :adi:`LTC7000` datasheet for more information.

- R9, R31, R120 = 0.015 (R_SENSE)
- R12, R34, R123 = 105K (R_ISET)

**Overtemperature Settings**

The MAX6516 is manages the overvoltage event. You can adjust the hysteresis to
your desired value.

Inrush Current Limiter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Driving large capacitive loads such as complex electrical systems with large
bypass capacitors should be powered using the circuit shown in the figure
below.

.. figure:: inrush_current_limiter.png

   Inrush Current Limiter Circuit

The pull-up gate drive to the power MOSFET from TGUP is passed through an RC
delay network, RG and CG, which greatly reduces the turn-on ramp rate of the
MOSFET. This dramatically reduces the inrush current from the source supply and
reduces the transient ramp rate of the load allowing for slower activation of
sensitive electrical loads such as power amplifiers.

The turn-off of the MOSFET is not affected by the RC delay network as the
pull-down for the MOSFET gate is directly from the TGDN pin. Note that the
voltage rating on capacitor CG needs to be the same or higher than the external
MOSFET and CLOAD.

The values for RG and CG to limit the inrush current can be calculated from the
below equation:

.. figure:: formula.png

On this application, we will use a <100mA inrush current.

     * Inrush current = 100mA
     * CLOAD = 20uF (HMC8500 Drain Bypass Capacitor)
     * CG = 10nF (assumed)

Using the formula above, RG = 200K.

   populated. The user will need to modify the board and install the appropriate
   values before using it.

System Performance
------------------

Power Sequencing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The system exhibits an automated bias sequencing required by a power amplifier
which minimizes human intervention and possible device damage. The default bias
sequence implemented follows the common GaN power amplifier
sequencing as shown below.

.. figure:: bias_sequencing_gan.png

   GaN Power Sequence

.. figure:: ldmos.png.jpg

   LDMOS Power Sequence

AD3552R DAC Settling Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The system enables an ultrafast sub-µs voltage settling time
for GaN gates from pinch-off to the normal operating voltage
by utilizing the AD3553R dual-channel, ultrafast, 16-bit DAC.
This rapid voltage transition allows the board to meet the TDD
switching requirements for biasing a GaN amplifier in RF front-end
applications, such as 5G base station radio units.

The typical voltage transition time from GaN pinch-off to its normal
operating voltage is shown in the figure below.

.. figure:: pinch_off_to_normal.png

   Settling Time from Pinch-off to Normal

.. figure:: normal_to_pinch_off.png

   Settling Time from Normal to Pinch-off

Fault Event
~~~~~~~~~~~

The system can protect itself against undesirable fault incidents,
such as overvoltage, overcurrent, and overtemperature events.
The on-board :adi:`LTC7000` handles overvoltage (OV) and overcurrent (OC)
fault detection, while the :adi:`MAX6516` is responsible for temperature
monitoring and detection.

The table below shows the preset threshold for each parameter.

=============== =====================
Safety Features
=============== =====================
Fault Event     Fault Threshold Limit
Overvoltage     +55V
Overcurrent     3.5 A
Overtemperature +75°C
=============== =====================

.. tip::
   Users can define the fault threshold limits based on their application
   by adjusting resistor values. Consult the schematic for the resistor values.

Fault Time Response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The system also exhibits fast fault detection and flagging.

**Figure 21** shows the time elapsed from when the LTC7000 detects a fault to
when it sends a signal to the microcontroller. Under normal conditions, the
FAULT pin of the LTC7000 remains HIGH. When a fault event occurs, the FAULT pin
is pulled to GND. The system took almost 1 µs to register the fault flag time.

.. figure:: flag_time.png

   Fault Detected Time

**Figure 22** shows the time it takes for the microcontroller to process the
fault signal coming from the LTC7000 and perform the required power-down
sequencing. The system took almost 5 µs to register the fault flag time.

.. figure:: mcu_time.png

Thermal Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Figure 23** shows the temperature of the AD-PAARRAY3552R-SL board in normal operating
conditions. This is the situation when all of the bias pins are sourcing their
specified loads under normal operations.
