Embedded Software
-----------------

The :adi:`AD-PAARRAY3552R` is accompanied by an open-source software stack
and associated collateral, enabling a complete experience from
evaluation and prototyping all the way to production firmware and applications
development.

The system‘s firmware is based on Analog Devices’ open-source
:git-no-OS:`ADI's no-OS framework </>`, which includes most of the tools required
for embedded code development and debugging as well as libraries enabling host-side
connectivity for system configuration and data transfer over UART.

Updating the Firmware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most common way of programming the system is by dragging and dropping
the provided .hex file to the DAPLINK drive. Using the drag-and-drop method,
the software is going to be a version that Analog Devices creates for
testing and evaluation purposes. This is the easiest way to get started
with the reference design.

Setting up the MAX32625PICO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To update the board’s firmware, a new bootloader has to be flashed
on the MAX32625PICO. Follow below procedure:

#. Download the firmware image:

   :download:`MAX32625PICO Firmware <max32625_max32666fthr_if_crc_swd_v1.0.5.bin.zip>`

#. Do not connect the MAX32625PICO from the PC and the AD-PAARRAY3552R-SL
   board.
#. Plug the micro-USB cable only in the MAX32625PICO.
#. Press the button on the MAX32625PICO and then plug the other end of the
   micro-USB cable into the PC. **(Do not release the button until the
   MAINTENANCE drive is mounted)**.

      :width: 200px

#. Release the button once the MAINTENANCE drive is mounted.
#. Drag and drop (to the MAINTENANCE drive) the firmware image.
#. After a few seconds, the MAINTENANCE drive will disappear and be replaced by
   a drive named DAPLINK. This indicates that the process is complete, and the
   MAX32625PICO can now be used to flash the firmware of the AD-PAARRAY3552R-SL
   board.

Programming the AD-PAARRAY3552R-SL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Connect the MAX32625PICO to the AD-PAARRAY3552R-SL board using the 10-pin
   ribbon cable.
#. Connect the 48 V power supply to the AD-PAARRAY3552R-SL. Make sure the board
   is powered up for the next steps.
#. A DAPLINK drive should appear as mounted on the PC.
#. Drag and drop the **AD-PAARRAY3552R-SLv1.0.0.hex** into the DAPLINK drive.
   After a few seconds, the drive will be remounted.
#. Check the DAPLINK directory and make sure there is no **FAIL.TXT** file. In
   case there is, repeat the drag and drop step. Otherwise, the MAX32625PICO can
   now be disconnected from the AD-PAARRAY3552R-SL, since the firmware update is
   complete.

Application Software
--------------------

The system also integrates a graphical user interface (GUI) that
continuously monitors crucial parameters. This interface facilitates complete
system control, enabling faster prototyping and development.
