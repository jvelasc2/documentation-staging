Overview
--------

The :adi:`AD-MAX32LRWISE-SL` development kit is a tool intended for
designing solutions based on low-power, long range proprietary
radio communication technique. This platform features the LR1110, an RF
transceiver based on spread spectrum modulation techniques derived from chirp
spread spectrum (CSS) technology, and supports a frequency range from 800 MHz to
960 MHz. This solution is also based on the MAX32670 ultralow power
microcontroller based on ARM Cortex-M4 processor.

The kit is composed of a development board and equipped with sensor modules,
providing users with a complete system that is suitable for quick prototyping
and development of IoT applications. The design includes a gateway, which is
crucial for establishing connectivity between the LPWAN devices and the
backend or application server. This component is vital for data transfer and
communication.

This also comes with software that allows users to observe nodes in a
graphical user interface (GUI) dashboard. This feature enhances the monitoring
and management capabilities of the system. To use the development board, users
need to flash it with functional firmware. A simple join example has been
open-sourced, providing more flexibility and easy customization in terms of
firmware development.

What is a Base Board?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Base Board contains an RF transceiver chip and a microcontroller, which
combine all the required elements for long range communication. This platform
uses the chirp spread spectrum technique, allowing sensors to connect to a
network and send and receive data in long distances.

MAX32670-LR-ARDZ Base Board
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The MAX32670-LR-ARDZ Base board consists of the MAX32670 high-reliability,
ultralow power microcontroller based on Arm Cortex-M4 processor, and the LR1110
long range RF transceiver module.

.. figure:: max32670-lr-ardz_base_board.png

What are Sensor Nodes?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sensor nodes are devices that send or receive messages through wireless
communication to and back from the gateways. These devices communicate with
nearby gateways connected through a network server. Depending on the intended
applications, sensors can transmit various type of data such as temperature,
flow rate, vibration, etc.

EV-CATTLETAG-ARDZ Sensor for Livestock Monitoring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :adi:`EV-CATTLETAG-ARDZ` is a system module that uses ADI power solution
on the controller and transceiver module used for virtual fencing solution
for livestock, where the animals are controlled by GPS-collars and an app.
The system is consisting of a MAX20361 power harvester, MAX20335 BMS,
and a MAX30210 temperature sensor and a buzzer with an option for vibration
motor.

System Setup
------------

PHASE 1: Hardware Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that this setup only applies for MAX32670-LR-ARDZ Base Board. Users may use
a different base board or microcontroller, however the firmware built for this
demo application cannot be used as this is specifically designed for the
MAX32670-LR-ARDZ.

Equipment Needed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- One (1) :adi:`MAX32670-LR-ARDZ` Base Board
- One (1) :adi:`EV-CATTLETAG-ARDZ` Sensor Node
- One (1) MAX32625PICO Rapid Development Platform with 10-pin ribbon cable
  with firmware image: max32625pico-firmware-images/raw/master/bin/max32625_max32670evkit_if_crc_swd_v1.0.3.bin
- One (1) CR123A Battery or any equivalent external DC power supply (+3V to +4.7V)
  ** Note that this is not included in the kit**
- One (1) Micro USB to USB cable
-  Host PC (Windows 10 or later)

.. figure:: hardware_setup.png

#. Insert one CR123A battery (3V to 4.7V) into the battery holder
   (BT1 connector) of the :adi:`MAX32670-LR-ARDZ` Base Board.

   .. tip::

      Make sure to check for the battery polarity in the BT1 connector, refer
      to the figure below. The DS3 LED will light up indicating that you have
      inserted the battery correctly and that power is provided in the base
      board.

   .. figure:: max32670-lr-ardz_with_battery.png

#. Connect the :adi:`EV-CATTLETAG-ARDZ` to the :adi:`MAX32670-LR-ARDZ` Base Board
   by aligning the corresponding Arduino headers on each board.
#. Connect the `MAX32625PICO :adi:`MAX32625PICO` programming adapter to the
   :adi:`MAX32670-LR-ARDZ` Base Board through the 10-pin
   ribbon cable.

   .. tip::

      Make sure that the MAX32625PICO programming adapter has been flashed with
      the correct image before connecting it to the MAX32670-LR-ARDZ Base
      Board.

**How to flash the firmware image in the MAX32625PICO**

#. Download the firmware image:
   `MAX32625PICO Firmware Image for MAX32670 <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/max32625pico-firmware-images/raw/master/bin/max32625_max32670evkit_if_crc_swd_v1.0.3.bin>`__
#. Do not connect the MAX32625PICO to the :adi:`MAX32670-LR-ARDZ` Base Board yet.
#. Connect the MAX32625PICO to the Host PC using the micro USB to USB cable.
#. Press the button on the MAX32625PICO. **(Do not release the button until the
   MAINTENANCE drive is mounted)**.

   .. figure:: max32625pico_maxdap.png
      :width: 300 px

#. Release the button once the MAINTENANCE drive is mounted.
#. Drag and drop (to the MAINTENANCE drive) the firmware image.
#. After a few seconds, the MAINTENANCE drive will disappear and be replaced by
   a drive named DAPLINK. This indicates that the process is complete, and the
   MAX32625PICO can now be used to flash the firmware of the
   :adi:`MAX32670-LR-ARDZ` Base Board.

#. Connect the :adi:`MAX32625PICO` programming adapter to the
   Host PC using the micro USB to USB cable.

FAQs
----

- **Q.** Why is the serial application not responding after opening the port?
- **A.** It usually happens whenever the power of the base board is not enough to operate the board.

- **Q.** Can we use other gateways aside from ChirpStack?
- **A.** Customers are not limited to use ChirpStack gateway, it is possible to use
   other gateways available in the market.

- **Q.** What maximum number a gateway can handle?
- **A.** It depends on the channels available per assigned region and the time
   division set by the user on sending data from the nodes to gateway.

- **Q.** Is there another way to see the GUI without using the local setup?
- **A.** The GUI can also be accessed through cloud service, but it is not supported by ADI.

- **Q.** What is the maximum distance the gateway and nodes can communicate?
- **A.** The gateway and nodesâ€™ maximum and effective range may vary depending on
   the modulation parameters, transmit power, antenna gain, environmental
   conditions, and obstacles present in the communication path. In practice, it
   can reach several kilometers in rural areas with a clear line of sight. The
   effective range may be shorter in urban areas where obstacle and interference
   are present.
