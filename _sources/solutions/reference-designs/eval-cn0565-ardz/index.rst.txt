    EVAL-CN0565-ARDZ Evaluation Board

The :adi:`EVAL-CN0565-ARDZ <CN0565>` is an electrical impedance
tomography (EIT) measurement system for characterizing and computing interior
impedance of surfaces. The platform allows a conductivity map to be
reconstructed using several repeating measurements from electrodes placed at
different locations. It supports impedance measurement setups with up to 24
electrodes. The design uses a pair 8x12 analog crosspoint switches, which
enables the excitation signal to be applied to one pair of electrodes at a
time. The implementation of crosspoint switches allows the circuit to maximize
the impedance measurements, which consequently improves the resolution of the
constructed images.

The design also features a complete power and signal isolation to the host
controller, which can be used as reference for bioimpedance applications.
The board comes in an Arduino-compatible form factor and includes an
industry-standard software interface, allowing easy integration to end-user
systems as well to connect up to external development platforms such as the
:adi:`EVAL-ADICUP3029`.

Python Example Scripts
----------------------

Two sample scripts have been created to execute EIT measurements in the
EVAL-CN0565-ARDZ. The **Specific Electrode Pair script** allows the user to
measure the impedance on a specific electrode pair, whereas the **Electrode
Tomography script** examines the impedance of the entire test board across all
electrodes.

Using the Specific Electrode Pair Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Open the command terminal and direct the current working directory to where
  the example script is saved.
- Run the script by entering this command:

    .. code-block:: python

        python cn0565_example_single.py
        python cn0565_example_single.py 0 1 1 0

Prompting these commands in the terminal will give you the **Amplitude,
Frequency and Baud Rate**, **Electrode Pair, Rectangular and Polar Form
Impedance**, and the **Real and Imaginary Impedance** for the specific electrode
pair.
