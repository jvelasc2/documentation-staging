Components and Connections
---------------------------

Power Analyzer Board Connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The LTpowerAnalyzer Main Board (LB3031A) extends the electrical capabilities
of the ADALM2000 Active Learning Module (M2K) by providing an analog signal
chain interface that can accommodate ±100 VDC of differential input voltage at
its ports. This enables a broader range of power supply DUTs that can be
evaluated with the ADALM2000.

   LTpowerAnalyzer Board (LB3031A) Pinout

Current Probe Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The current probes are used to generate a current pulse for the transient
measurement, and a sine wave current for the impedance measurement. There are
four versions of the LB3058A: 1A, 10A, 50A, and 100A full scale with a 20V
maximum output voltage. Each probe has three current sources in parallel to
provide a wide dynamic range and distribute the power dissipation at full scale.
The probes are connected to the Power Analyzer board using a 14-pin ribbon
cable, which is the same as the DC590. The probe is designed to work for
positive voltages only, and the FET body diode will turn on if the + pin is
pulled below -. The software will automatically recognize which probe is
connected, and adjust the current range accordingly. The probes are not designed
to generate a continuous DC current due to their small size.

.. figure:: current_probes.jpg

   LB3058A Current Probe Modules: 1A, 10A, 50A, and 100A

The minimum resolution of the current probe is determined by the maximum
offset of the amplifier driving the MOSFET in each of the three power stages
(2 mV) and is equal to the maximum current for each power stage divided by 100.
For example, the 10 A current probe has a maximum current limit of 12 A
and will have the following minimum resolution:

================== =============================== ===================
**Load Current**   **Number of Power Stages Used** **Minimum Current**
0A to 3.999A        1                               40 mA
4A to 7.999A        2                               80 mA
8A to 12A           3                               120 mA
================== =============================== ===================

The current probe has circuitry that measures the DUT output voltage and the
board temperature. Before running a measurement, the software estimates the
temperature rise of the current source FETs based on the DUT output voltage, the
current waveform profile, and the measured board temperature. If the calculation
predicts that the maximum safe operating area (SOA) of FETs would be exceeded,
the measurement will not run.

The current probe connection to the board must be made to minimize the parasitic
inductance and resistance. The best way to do this for currents > ~5A is to
scrape away an opening in the solder mask on the board, then solder the probe
directly to the board using a piece of solder braid folded at a 90-degree angle
on either side to provide a strong mechanical connection.

      :width: 220 px

      Socket Connection

For smaller currents, the probe can be connected via turrets or wire to the
board. The current probe can also be mated with the 60-pin surface mount
connector from Samtec, model HSEC8-130-01-S-DV-A, Digikey #SAM9504-ND. The
solder mask can be scraped off and the socket soldered to the board power
planes.

Standard Kelvin Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Bode Plot for a typical power supply is generated by injecting a small AC
signal through a transformer across a small resistor (Rs), which is inserted
into the external feedback resistor string. At each frequency, the AC
differential voltage at IN and OUT is measured and the gain and phase are
calculated using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. The typical
connection ties IN- and OUT- to GND. By making the signal injector and input
signal amplifiers AC-coupled, a ±100 VDC common-mode voltage can be accommodated
with a frequency range of 100 Hz to 10 MHz. 

.. figure:: voutrangeextension.png

    Standard 4-Wire Connection

At low frequencies, the open loop gain of the supply is high, so most of the
injected AC signal appears at OUT and a tiny amount at IN. At the crossover
frequency, the injected signal is evenly split between IN and OUT, and at high
frequencies when the gain is less than one, most of the injected signal appears
at IN.

A typical setup will use short length 24 to 32 gauge twisted pair wires that are
soldered directly to Rs on the DUT board, and the other ends inserted into the
screw terminals on the LB3031A or the interface board. The setup requires a
kelvin connection that has 4 wires (T+, OUT+, T-, IN+) connected to Rs to get
the best results.

The LB3058A current probe must be connected to the DUT board with a minimum of
series resistance and inductance. The output voltage for the transient and
impedance measurements should be sensed directly at the output capacitors on the
DUT and is measured though a fully differential signal path. The LB3058A current
probe is not designed to generate a constant DC current due to its small size,
so an external DC load generator will be needed for the Bode Plot and Output
Impedance measurements. The transient measurement does not require an external
DC load current as long as the pulse times are short.

The ground plane of the DUT must be connected to the GND pin on the terminal
block.

Kelvin vs. Two-Wire Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example is shown below where 6-inches of 30 gauge twisted pair wire was used
for the two-wire and kelvin connections.

.. figure:: system2.png

   2-Wire Bode Plot Connection

The results below 5 kHz are quite different because the voltage drop across the
wires swamps out the signal at the input, which is very low because of the high
open loop gain. The two sweeps merge as the open loop gain drops and the input
signal level increases. Notice however, that the phase margin and gain margin
are the same for the two sweeps.

Module Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many power modules include the top side feedback resistor R1 inside the package,
requiring only one external Many power modules include the top side feedback
resistor R1 inside the package, requiring only one external resistor R2 to set
the output voltage. In this case, the injection resistor Rs cannot be inserted
at the top of the feedback network but is instead connected to ground at the
bottom.

To measure the true loop gain, another dummy resistor divider, R3 and R4, is
connected to the output. The ratio of R3/R4 must be the same as the ratio of
R1/R2. The problem with this topology is that many network analyzers have up to
50 pF of input capacitance, which forms a pole at the R3/R4 connection point.
This can lead to gain and phase errors when the frequency reaches the 50 kHz to
1 MHz range, depending on the absolute value of R3 and R4. The best practice is
to reduce the absolute value or R3 compared to R1, and R4 compared to R2 by a
factor of 10 to 100, pushing the pole out to beyond the frequencies of interest.
The input impedance of the LTpowerAnalyzer is about 1 pF in parallel with 1 MΩ,
which should minimize this problem.

LED Driver Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this type of connection, the test voltage is injected across Rs which is in
series with the ISN current sense line, and input and output voltage must be
measured differentially from the respective Rs connection to the ISP current
sense line.

The common-mode range of the LTPowerAnalyzer is ±100V, and Rs is typically 20Ω
to 40Ω.
